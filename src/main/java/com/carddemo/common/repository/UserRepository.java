/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository interface for User entity providing database access methods 
 * for authentication and user management operations in the CardDemo modernized credit card
 * management system.
 * 
 * This repository replaces legacy COBOL COSGN00C.cbl VSAM USRSEC file read operations 
 * with modern PostgreSQL database access patterns, supporting JWT-based Spring Security 
 * authentication and BCrypt password validation.
 * 
 * Repository Methods:
 * - findByUserId(): Primary authentication credential lookup replacing VSAM USRSEC read
 * - findByUserIdIgnoreCase(): Case-insensitive user lookup for authentication flexibility
 * - findByUserType(): Role-based user queries for Spring Security authorization
 * - existsByUserId(): User existence validation for registration and administrative functions
 * - countByUserType(): Administrative reporting queries for user management operations
 * - findUsersWithRecentLogin(): Security monitoring queries for compliance and audit
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Leverages PostgreSQL B-tree primary index on user_id for sub-millisecond lookup times
 * - Spring Data JPA automatic transaction management with SERIALIZABLE isolation level
 * - HikariCP connection pooling optimized for authentication workload patterns
 * - Integration with Spring Security context for seamless JWT token validation workflows
 * 
 * Security Integration:
 * - BCrypt password hash validation through Spring Security PasswordEncoder
 * - Spring @Transactional integration for atomic authentication operations
 * - Audit trail support through Spring Boot Actuator for compliance requirements
 * - User type mapping for Spring Security role-based access control (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER)
 * 
 * Migration Context:
 * - Replaces EXEC CICS READ DATASET('USRSEC') operations from COBOL authentication logic
 * - Maintains equivalent functionality while providing modern cloud-native scalability
 * - Supports horizontal scaling across multiple microservice instances
 * - Enables distributed authentication through Redis session management

    /**
     * Find user by user ID for authentication credential lookup.
     * This method replaces the legacy COBOL EXEC CICS READ DATASET('USRSEC') operation
     * from COSGN00C.cbl, providing equivalent functionality with modern Spring Data JPA patterns.
     * 
     * Equivalent COBOL Logic:
     * ```
     * EXEC CICS READ
     *      DATASET   (WS-USRSEC-FILE)
     *      INTO      (SEC-USER-DATA)
     *      RIDFLD    (WS-USER-ID)
     *      KEYLENGTH (LENGTH OF WS-USER-ID)
     *      RESP      (WS-RESP-CD)
     * END-EXEC
     * ```
     * 
     * Spring Security Integration:
     * This method is the foundation of JWT authentication workflow, enabling:
     * - Primary credential validation during login requests
     * - BCrypt password hash verification through Spring Security PasswordEncoder
     * - User type extraction for Spring Security role mapping (Admin vs Regular user)
     * - Session context establishment for pseudo-conversational processing
     * 
     * Performance Optimization:
     * - Utilizes PostgreSQL primary B-tree index on user_id column for optimal retrieval
     * - Automatic Spring Data JPA caching through @Cacheable annotation support
     * - Sub-5ms response time target for authentication credential lookup
     * - HikariCP connection pool optimization for high-frequency authentication requests
