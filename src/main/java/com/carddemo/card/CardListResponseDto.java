/**
 * Response DTO for card listing operations with pagination metadata, role-based data masking, 
 * and comprehensive field mappings providing structured API responses for COCRDLIC.cbl functionality.
 * 
 * This DTO transforms the legacy COBOL COCRDLIC card listing screen into a modern REST API response
 * structure while preserving all original business logic, pagination behavior, and user interaction 
 * patterns. The response supports 7 cards per page display (matching WS-MAX-SCREEN-LINES from COBOL)
 * and includes comprehensive metadata for pagination navigation equivalent to PF7/PF8 functionality.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Extends BaseResponseDto for consistent API response structure across microservices
 * - Includes PaginationMetadata matching COBOL WS-CA-SCREEN-NUM pagination logic
 * - Supports role-based data masking for sensitive card information (PCI compliance)
 * - Provides comprehensive card data arrays for React Material-UI component consumption
 * - Maintains exact field sequencing and navigation semantics from original BMS screen
 * - Includes OpenAPI documentation annotations for automated API documentation generation
 * 
 * Business Logic Preservation:
 * - Page size fixed at 7 cards matching COBOL WS-MAX-SCREEN-LINES constant
 * - Pagination navigation indicators replicate CA-FIRST-PAGE and CA-LAST-PAGE logic
 * - Search criteria handling equivalent to COBOL CC-ACCT-ID and CC-CARD-NUM filters
 * - Selection functionality supporting 'S' (view) and 'U' (update) operations
 * - Data masking based on user authorization levels (admin vs user roles)
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - Response generation within 200ms at 95th percentile for optimal user experience
 * - Support for 10,000+ TPS through efficient DTO serialization and minimal object allocation
 * - Memory usage optimization through selective data loading and masking
 * - Jackson JSON serialization performance optimization through property ordering
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Card number masking for non-admin users (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234 format)
 * - CVV code exclusion from response payload for PCI DSS compliance
 * - Authorization level validation for sensitive field access control
 * - Audit trail support through BaseResponseDto timestamp and correlation tracking
 *
