/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository interface for TransactionCategoryBalance entity management.
 * Provides PostgreSQL composite primary key operations matching VSAM TRAN-CAT-KEY structure
 * per Section 6.2.1.2, supporting granular balance management by transaction category.
 * 
 * This repository implements comprehensive financial balance operations including:
 * - Balance lookup operations equivalent to COBOL TRAN-CAT-KEY access patterns
 * - Bulk update operations for batch processing within 4-hour processing window
 * - Aggregation queries for financial reporting and account analysis operations
 * - Materialized view integration for account balance summary operations per Section 6.2.6.4
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Composite primary key support via TransactionCategoryBalanceId for unique balance tracking
 * - BigDecimal precision maintenance equivalent to COBOL COMP-3 arithmetic for financial accuracy
 * - PostgreSQL B-tree index optimization for sub-200ms response times at 10,000+ TPS
 * - SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation level for VSAM-equivalent locking behavior
 * - Spring @Transactional support with REQUIRES_NEW propagation for batch processing
 * - Custom @Query methods with proper JOIN operations for related entity access
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - Balance lookup operations: < 50ms response time via composite index optimization
 * - Bulk update operations: Support for 1000+ record chunks in batch processing
 * - Aggregation queries: < 100ms for account-level balance summaries
 * - Memory usage: Optimized with FetchType.LAZY relationships to related entities
 * 
 * Business Rules Enforced:
 * - Balance precision maintained exactly equivalent to COBOL PIC S9(09)V99 format
 * - Composite key uniqueness ensuring one balance per account-category combination
 * - Foreign key integrity with Account and TransactionCategory entities
 * - Audit timestamp tracking for balance modification history
 * 
 * Integration Points:
