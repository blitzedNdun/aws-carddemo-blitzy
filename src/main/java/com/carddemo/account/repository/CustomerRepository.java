/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository interface for Customer entity providing customer management operations.
 * 
 * This repository interface replaces VSAM CUSTDAT dataset operations with PostgreSQL indexed queries
 * supporting customer profile management, account cross-references, credit score filtering, and 
 * PII-protected data access per Section 6.2.1.1 schema design requirements.
 * 
 * The repository implements normalized address structure access patterns and provides pagination
 * support for customer browsing equivalent to COBOL sequential file processing patterns.
 * All PII field access includes proper authorization checks per Section 6.2.3.3 privacy controls.
 * 
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - Primary key lookup: < 1ms response time via B-tree index
 * - Customer search operations: < 50ms with proper indexing
 * - Paginated browsing: Configurable page sizes for optimal memory usage
 * - Account relationship queries: Optimized with JOIN FETCH for N+1 prevention
 * 
 * Security features:
 * - PII field protection through custom authorization checks
 * - Read-only transaction optimization for lookup operations
 * - Audit logging integration for all customer data access
