/**
 * Spring Data JPA Repository interface for Customer entity providing comprehensive
 * customer management operations with PII-protected data access, account cross-references, 
 * and credit score filtering capabilities.
 * 
 * This repository replaces VSAM CUSTDAT dataset operations with PostgreSQL indexed queries,
 * supporting customer profile management and account relationship operations while maintaining
 * data privacy controls and audit compliance per Section 6.2.3.3.
 * 
 * Original COBOL Operations Replaced:
 * - COACTVWC.cbl customer data retrieval (EXEC CICS READ DATASET CUSTDAT)
 * - SEARCH ALL constructs for customer lookup operations
 * - Sequential file processing patterns for customer browsing
 * - COBOL 88-level conditions for customer status validation
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - JOIN FETCH optimization for customer-account relationship queries
 * - PII field access control with proper authorization checks
 * - Credit score range filtering for customer screening operations
 * - Pagination support matching COBOL sequential file processing patterns
 * - @Transactional read-only queries for performance optimization
 * - Database-level indexing strategy for sub-200ms response times
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - All queries must complete within 200ms at 95th percentile
 * - Support for 10,000+ TPS throughput with horizontal scaling
 * - Memory usage within 10% increase limit compared to CICS allocation
 * - PostgreSQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level for VSAM-equivalent locking
 * 
 * Security Compliance:
 * - PII fields (SSN, government_issued_id) require special authorization per Section 6.2.3.3
 * - All data access operations logged for audit compliance via Spring Boot Actuator
 * - Row-level security policies enforced at PostgreSQL database level
