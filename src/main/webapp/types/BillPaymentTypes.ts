/**
 * BillPaymentTypes.ts
 * 
 * TypeScript interface definitions for bill payment screen (COBIL00) including payment 
 * form data, confirmation workflow, EFT processing, and payment history tracking types.
 * 
 * This file provides comprehensive type definitions for the BillPaymentComponent React 
 * screen that replicates the original COBIL00 BMS mapset structure while enabling modern
 * payment processing capabilities with Spring Boot PaymentService integration.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Bill payment form data structure matching COBIL00 BMS field definitions
 * - Payment confirmation workflow with transaction verification capabilities
 * - EFT payment method management for bank account routing and validation
 * - Payment history tracking with audit trail for compliance and reporting
 * - Financial amount precision types for PostgreSQL NUMERIC(12,2) compatibility
 * - BMS field attribute mapping for React form validation integration
 * 
 * Technical Integration:
 * - Maps to PaymentService REST endpoints (/api/payments/process)
 * - Integrates with Spring Security for payment authorization
 * - Uses PostgreSQL payment tables for transaction persistence
 * - Supports Redis session management for payment workflow state
