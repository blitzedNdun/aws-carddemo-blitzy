-- Daily Transaction Precision Tests for CardDemo Application
-- =====================================================================================
-- 
-- Purpose: BigDecimal precision validation tests for daily transaction amount calculations
--          ensuring exact COBOL COMP-3 arithmetic equivalence for batch processing
-- 
-- COBOL Source: CVTRA06Y.cpy - DALYTRAN-AMT field (PIC S9(09)V99)
-- Target Implementation: DailyTransactionPostingJob.java with BigDecimal precision
-- Database Schema: PostgreSQL NUMERIC(12,2) with DECIMAL128 context
-- 
-- Test Coverage:
-- - COBOL COMP-3 to BigDecimal conversion accuracy
-- - Daily transaction amount precision validation
-- - Batch processing BigDecimal arithmetic equivalence
-- - Financial calculation zero-tolerance accuracy verification
-- - Edge cases and boundary conditions testing
-- 
-- Compliance: Section 0.3.1 batch processing approach with exact decimal precision
-- Performance: Supports < 200ms response time and 4-hour batch processing window
