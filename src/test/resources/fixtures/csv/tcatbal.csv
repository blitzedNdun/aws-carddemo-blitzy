# Transaction Category Balance Test Data
# CSV fixture for comprehensive testing of transaction category balance processing
# Supports Spring Batch testing, composite primary key validation, and financial precision testing
# 
# Schema: account_id (VARCHAR(11)), transaction_category (VARCHAR(4)), category_balance (DECIMAL(12,2)), last_updated (TIMESTAMP)
# Primary Key: (account_id, transaction_category)
# Foreign Keys: account_id -> accounts.account_id, transaction_category -> transaction_categories.transaction_category
#
# Test Scenarios Covered:
# 1. Composite primary key constraint testing with unique combinations
# 2. Balance calculation validation with positive, negative, and zero values
# 3. Financial precision testing with DECIMAL(12,2) values
# 4. Category-specific balance tracking across multiple accounts
# 5. Timestamp validation for last_updated field
# 6. Balance aggregation testing scenarios
# 7. Foreign key relationship validation
# 8. Edge cases for balance limits and precision
#
# Data Source: Converted from app/data/ASCII/tcatbal.txt mainframe fixed-width format
# Original COBOL Structure: TRAN-CAT-BAL-RECORD (CVTRA01Y.cpy)
# Target Entity: TransactionCategoryBalance.java with composite primary key
account_id,transaction_category,category_balance,last_updated
# Basic test scenarios with zero balances - Initial state testing
