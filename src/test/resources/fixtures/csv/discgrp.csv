# DISCLOSURE GROUP CSV TEST FIXTURE
# =============================================================================
# Comprehensive test data for disclosure group reference table supporting
# Spring Batch processing, BigDecimal precision validation, and integration
# testing scenarios for the CardDemo credit card management system.
#
# This CSV fixture supports:
# - Interest rate configuration testing with DECIMAL(5,4) precision
# - Spring Batch FlatFileItemReader test scenarios  
# - PostgreSQL reference table integration testing
# - Business rule validation for disclosure group assignment
# - Rate calculation validation with BigDecimal arithmetic precision
# - Legal disclosure text validation and effective date processing
#
# Data Structure Maps to DisclosureGroup JPA Entity:
# - group_id: VARCHAR(10) - unique interest rate group identifier
# - disclosure_text: TEXT - legal disclosure content for regulatory compliance
# - interest_rate: DECIMAL(5,4) - annual percentage rate with 4 decimal precision
# - effective_date: TIMESTAMP - rate effectiveness timestamp for tracking
#
# Source: Converted from app/data/ASCII/discgrp.txt maintaining exact
#         functional equivalence per Section 0.3.2 requirements
# 
# Author: Blitzy agent
# Created: CSV test fixture supporting comprehensive testing scenarios
