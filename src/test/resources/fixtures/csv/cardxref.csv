# - last_updated: Last update timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)
# - notes: Additional notes for test scenario identification
#
# Test Scenarios Included:
# 1. Valid card-to-account relationships with proper foreign key references
# 2. Multiple cards per account testing composite relationships
# 3. Single card per customer testing one-to-one relationships
# 4. Cross-reference constraint validation test cases
# 5. Edge cases for orphaned references and constraint violation testing
# 6. Inactive relationship testing for lifecycle management
# 7. Date-based relationship testing for temporal queries
# 8. Bulk relationship testing for Spring Batch processing validation
#
